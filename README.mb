[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opprimendi/graphicscorelib.svg)](https://travis-ci.orgopprimendi/graphicscorelib)
==================================================

A Flash Platform SDK, a nice toolbox with libs for every ActionScript 3 developer.

THIS SDK IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT

Current work items:
- organize; move things out of top level packages. Add testing directories.
- test framework for all tests.

Current Projects:

AGALMiniAssembler
	The Mini assembler generates AGAL byte code from a simple
	source text language. AGAL byte code is required for Molehill,
	the Flash 3D API. The MiniAssembler is a run time assembler -
	it is an AS3 class that is a part of your 3D app.

AGALMiniAssembler
	The Mini assembler for Stage3D extended profile.

AGALMacroAssembler
	The Macro assembler extends the Mini assembler with macros (similar
	to functions), basic math expressions, aliases, and constant allocation.

	Status: Alpha, initial testing (not yet uploaded)
	Test suite: TBD

FractalGeometryGenerator
	TBD

PerspectiveMatrix3D
	A class for creating perspective matrices, for use in 3D applications.

	Status: Beta, in use by early adopters
	Test suite: TBD
	
Sprite3D
	A Sprite layer on top of the Molehill APIs (Stage3D).
	
	Status: Beta, in use by early adopters
	Test suite: TBD
